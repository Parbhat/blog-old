[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high level programming language. The developer time is precious so using Linux based operating systems makes the development easier and fun.

I had been using windows for a couple of months for my [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Projects. Initially during my learning stage windows was working fine for me but as the knowledge and project size growed I faced many difficulties which I want to summarize here. I am not supporting any operating system here but want every Developer to understand the reasons for switching.For following reasons every Developer should switch to Linux based OS like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for Python Development.
